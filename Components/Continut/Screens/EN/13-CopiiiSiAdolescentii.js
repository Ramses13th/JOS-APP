        Your interest in Satan is very positive and is a strong sign you are
        seeking the truth. It is important that you put aside all prejudices in
        coming to know Satan. Most of what you have probably heard about him
        from non-Satanic sources are from his enemies and people who hate him
        for no real reason, other than this is what they were taught to believe.
        Others hate him, as he is a huge threat to their personal power, wealth
        and control as these have been built upon lies.

        Many lies have been told about Satan and his Demons. These lies have
        been forced upon people. Fear, lies and force have been used as weapons
        for hundreds of years. Satan and his Demons are NOT EVIL!! They are the
        ones who brought knowledge to humanity, so that we can be free. Satan is
        our True Creator God. Satan wants for us to be spiritually free. The
        Christian god is false. The Christian god is a murderer and a liar from
        the beginning and everything the Christians accuse the Devil of in their
        own bible is really their own god. Satan never murdered anyone Satan
        never lied to anyone Satan accepts you as you are, and does not hate
        human nature Satan rules over what is called 'the occult' which is
        completely spiritual Satan gives us knowledge and does not fear human
        spiritual advancement Satan does not fear humanity Christianity is not a
        religion; it is a program to stop people from knowing about and using
        the powers of their minds and souls known as ï¿½witchcraft.ï¿½ Satan has
        been treated horribly by those who hate him for no good reason and who
        also hate humanity and try to enslave us. They want to keep spiritual
        knowledge and power in the hands of a few.

        Satanism is NOT about Role Playing Games, human or animal sacrifice;
        blood drinking, horror, gore, or harming those who do not deserve it.
        True Satanism is becoming a god and having god-like power. Satan is the
        liberator of humanity. Animals are sacred in Satanism and should be
        treated with respect and well cared for. Many different animals are
        sacred to our Gods, such as snakes are sacred to Satan, cats and owls
        are sacred to Lilith, dogs to Anubis and many more.

        The only way to learn the real truth is to find it for yourself. We can
        never learn the real truth unless we can come to know both sides.
        Without knowing both sides, we cannot make a real choice. Truth is only
        known when we can think for ourselves, without making assumptions.
        Thinking for ourselves is listening to our own feelings and inner voice.
        Thinking for ourselves is not what we are told to think or believe by
        others. Those who wish to enslave and control others depend upon people
        believing everything they are told and not thinking for themselves.

          If you decide to join us in Satan, don't feel pressured. You don't
          have to dedicate your soul to become a Satanist. This is your choice
          and you should only do this if you really want to. Unlike the
          Christian ï¿½God,ï¿½ Satan doesn't push himself on anyone and we all
          come to him of our own free will. It is very important to treat Satan
          and his Demons with respect at all times. DON'T EVER SUMMON DEMONS FOR
          FUN OR TO PLAY AROUND. SUMMONING A DEMON IS VERY SERIOUS. If you are
          in trouble or are having big problems, Satan and his Demons will help
          you. Demons work with us through

        Satan is different from the false Christian God and his Nazarene [Jesus
        Christ]. Satan will ALWAYS help his people when they are having problems
        or are in need. With the violence in today's world and in the schools,
        his help is everything. The Nazarene has a long track record of turning
        his back on his followers in their time of need, as he is fictitious and
        human-hating entities pretend to be him. This is because he is no more
        than a thoughtform. The legends of his disciples dying horrible deaths
        are to create a slave mentality in his followers. It is very important
        for a slave to be able to take a lot of abuse without questioning or
        fighting back. Also, slaves never have knowledge and to be a perfect
        slave, one must always believe and do what they are told and be
        illiterate.

        Satan shows us we are important. There are many times we can't fight
        back. There are people who are bigger or have more power, and adults who
        are mean and unfair. Satan has his Demons look out for us and take care
        of big problems that we cannot handle. Satan shows us how we can have
        power with using our minds. This is power that other people don't have.
        Satan gives us the knowledge to use this power to get what we want in
        life. We can have money, love, a good job, and many other things that we
        want. People who are mean to us get punished.

        Life can be real hard. When we come to Satan, he makes our lives better
        and happier. To learn more, read what is on this website. Some people
        who call themselves Satanists, really aren't. They don't believe in
        Satan. Satan is very real and he does exist. Those in power don't want
        people to believe in Satan because Satan gives power to the common
        people and this is a big threat to them. You need to get to know Satan
        for yourself and you will find he is very real.

        As long as you are under 18, you are not free, nor do you have the same
        rights as an adult. Whoever is taking care of you, your parents or a

        Christians try very hard to force kids and teens into their beliefs.
        This is because you are young and don't have enough knowledge and
        experience from living and they know this. They don't let you explore
        both sides or other religions. This is because they want to control your
        mind. They don't want you to think for yourself. Many have hurt and
        abused children because this is what their religion teaches. If you are
        living in a Christian household, you have to be careful when you explore
        religions that Christians are taught to hate.

      <Text style={look.baseText}>
        To learn about Satan and his Demons, the first thing you can do is to
        read what is on this website. If you are living with Christians, you may
        not want to have any papers or books that they could find that could get
        you into trouble, so be very careful when using the internet. Learn how
        to clear your history and never forget to do this. There is software
        that your parents or school can buy that will tell them every site you
        have visited and also any passwords used on their computer. They may
        have this and not tell you. If you are sure they don't, be sure to clear
        out the history tracking on your tool bar and the cache, delete any
        sites you don't want them to know you visited. If your parents are
        Christians, they will more than likely get very upset with you for your
        interest in Satan.

          true, though the Christians try to hide it. It is historical fact.
          Only when you have enough knowledge, can you make the right choices.
          Take your time and learn and don't let anyone pressure you. Many
          choices you make and things you do now will affect the rest of your
          life. Learn everything you can about someone or something without
          prejudice before you choose. Don't let other people pressure you or do
          something just because other people do it or a bunch of people do it.
          Those of us who are with Satan are not slaves. Satanï¿½s Blessings to
          you and best wishes when you explore and learn. We hope that you will
