        It is a sad fact that few Satanists know the real meaning of our
        symbols. Most take false and erroneous information from Christian
        sources. Christians show their stupidity and ignorance incessantly.
        Knowledge is their most formidable enemy for no scam, no hoax, nor any
        lie can succeed when one has knowledge of the truth. Every Satanic
        symbol represents powerful spiritual meaning in regards to humanity
        reaching the godhead of spiritual and physical perfection and
        immortality. Most if not all Satanic symbols pertain to the true
        spiritual knowledge and the human soul.

          meditation and specific exercises, it ascends through the seven
          chakras, bringing intense awareness, enlightenment, psychic powers and
          abilities, and all-knowing. The hooded cobra, seen in many ancient
          carvings and paintings in Egypt, symbolizes the resulting expanded

          serpentine energy are on a much higher spiritual level and can no
          longer be deceived by Christianity and its related programs.

        The colors RED, WHITE, and BLACK - date back not only to Ancient Egypt,
        but to their origins in the Far East. Egypt was known as the "Black and

        of the human soul into the godhead. Through this transformation, we
        complete Our Creator Satan's unfinished work. The colors red, white and

        "DARKNESS" {"\n"}The association of "darkness" with Satanism has been
        totally twisted. This is not about spooks, ghouls or any other crap like
        that. Satanic "darkness" has to do with the "yin" in the "yang." This
        represents the female side of the soul; the subconscious mind that we
        access through meditation. The Serpent of Satan is of the female side of
        the soul. The male side of the soul is the logical side- the left brain.
        The female side is the right side of the brain. The soul has both
        positive and negative poles. Both the male and the female must work
        together. The logical male side; the left brain directs the female side
        through thought and will. The female side of the soul is the powerhouse
        of the soul. The female side makes manifest the thoughts and ideas
        generated from the male logical side. The female side is also the
        creative aspect of the soul; dreams, music, feelings and intuitions.
        Because of the power to direct one's own destiny and the spiritual
        freedom that comes with this are of the female side of the soul, the
        Christian Churches and their related ilk, such as Islam, work at
        promoting an inferior image of women; with Islam being brutal to women,
        and the incessant denegrations of women in the Judeo/Christian bible.
        All of this in addition reflects on the subconscious, subliminal level
        to suppress and deny the female power of the soul. Through centuries of
        this enforced garbage, which is nothing more than a program to remove
        spirituality, the female side of the soul and its powers have atrophied.
        This is why humanity and this world are in such an ugly mess right now.
        This has created a most serious imbalance that has become generational.
        Satanism works through power meditation to empower the female side of
        the soul to regain balance and restore spiritual health, along with
        empowering the individual.

        The "Devil's Pitchfork" is actually a very ancient symbol predating
        Christianity by thousands of years. This symbol originated in the Far
        East [where Christianity and its Jewish root stole from copiously;
        hideously perverting and corrupting the massive theft beyond recogntion,
        in order to destroy spiritual knowledge and keep spiritual power in the
        hands of the "Chosen" few]. It is known as the "TRISHUL" and symbolizes
        piercing through the three knots in the base, the heart and 6th chakras,
        also known as "granthis" in Sanskrit. For the serpent to ascend, all
        three must be open. The Trishul symbolizes the serpentine energy
        piercing through the three granthis.

        The image of Baphomet of western occultism was taken from the image of
        Shiva [above]. Note the position of the arms, one pointing upwards and
        the other downwards. The Baphomet again is symbolic of both the male and
        the female aspects of the soul. Note the Baphomet is both male and
        female, as also seen with in images of the Egyptian God Akhenaton. The
        horns are symbolic of Mercury, which is the vril, chi, witchpower,
        lifeforce, prana. The wings of the soul represent spiritual freedom. The
        goat symbolizes fertility- fertility in multiplying the life force,
        vril, which activates and raises the serpent. The "Goat of a Thousand
        Young" is referring to the crown chakra, "Sahasrara" in Sanskrit which
        means "Thousand Petaled Lotus."

        is the Kabbalistic square of the Sun. 666 is the all-important solar
        chakra. The true meaning of the "Temple of Solomon" is the TEMPLE OF THE
        SUN. "Sol" "Om" and "On" are all words for the Sun. "Sol" is the Latin
        word for the Sun and is close to the English word "soul." "Om" is a name
        given by the Hindus to the Spiritual Sun and "On" is an Egyptian word
        for Sun. The symbolism of the Temple of Solomon was stolen by the Jews
        and made into a fictitious character, as with the fictitous nazarene and
        nearly everything in the Judeo/Christian Bible. The true meaning of the
        "Temple of the Sun" is spiritual. This symbolizes the perfected soul,
        where the rays from the solar [666] chakra, which is the center of the
        soul and circulates spiritual energy, radiates into 8 separate rays. The
        shining soul is symbolized by the sun. 8 is the number of Astaroth. This
        is also "The New Jerusalem." The name of "Jerusalem" has also been
        stolen and corrupted into a city in Israel. "Jerusalem" IS A CONCEPT!

        The inverted cross is a very ancient symbol, YES, predating Christianity
        and its Jewish root by thousands of years. Its true meaning symbolizes
        the correct way of aligning the chakras. The all-important solar [666]
        chakra is aligned point down, and gives the soul its power.

        The Black Sun [astral Sun]. Hrim ties into the freemason Hiram Abiff.
        “presented to all candidates during the third degree in Freemasonry.”
        Note THIRD- the third solar chakra. The gold chakra. The Sun chakra,
        which is also symbolized by the swastika.

            Hiram Abiff (also Hiram Abif or the Widow's son) is the central
            character of an allegory presented to all candidates during the
            third degree in Freemasonry. Hiram is presented as the chief
            architect of King Solomon's Temple, who is murdered in the Temple he
            designed by three ruffians during an unsuccessful attempt to force
            him to divulge the Master Masons' secret passwords.

        NOTE: “Hiram is presented as the chief architect of King Solomon's
        Temple.” In other words, the solar chakra symbolized by the Satanic
        inverted cross, is the source of the magnum opus and the powerhouse of
        the soul. This is also symbolized by Thor's Hammer. The solar chakra is
        the "architect of the soul." All energy to empower your soul comes from
        this chakra. The solar chakra being located near the navel is also the
        spot where we were first nourished and given life in our mother's womb.
        Hiram Abiff is not a character, but a CONCEPT. The "secret passwords"
        are the mantras and words of power that awaken and empower the chakras.
        All of the ancient Pagan religions placed emphasis on the Sun. The Sun
        is the giver of life and this also includes the astral Sun of the soul;
        the "Temple of Solomon." The solar chakra also plays a key role in the
        magnum opus.
