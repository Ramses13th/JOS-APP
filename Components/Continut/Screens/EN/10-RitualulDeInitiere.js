          What happens when I make a formal commitment to Satan?
        </Text>
        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          Satan looks out for his own. Satan gives us an inner strength and we
          become very strong in spirit. Unlike right hand path religions, where
          adherents are forever praying and searching for their god, Satan comes
          to us on his own. Many times, we can feel him. He comes to guide us
          when we get down, worried, or are experiencing problems. He snaps us
          into line and directs us as to what we need to do to be focused and
          happy.
        </Text>

        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          The foundation of Spiritual Satanism is in our finishing Satan's work
          upon humanity. This is the goal of the godhead, and is accomplished
          through power meditation. Humanity is currently at a very low level
          spiritually. When we begin to meditate, we experience profound
          positive changes within our lives. Satan and his Demons (The Original
          Gods) protect us and look out for us as we transform and achieve
          personal power. With Satan, we have protection that outsiders do not
          have. We can advance in the powers of the mind and soul as far as we
          wish. For outsiders, this can prove dangerous.
        </Text>
        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          Satan also gives us knowledge. "I lead to the straight path without a
          book." As we transform and grow, our lives change for the better and
          we are much happier. We learn through Satan how to take control of our
          own lives and destiny instead of being at the mercy of fate. We learn
          to heal ourselves, and to fulfill our own desires, using the powers of
          our mind and soul.
        </Text>
        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          In making a commitment, we engage a formal ritual. This is done out of
          free will. We are making a choice, as opposed to being dragged off to
          some Christian church, and reciting canned prayers (stolen and
          corrupted from Eastern mantras) in front of a bunch of idiots.

            Because so many have been forcefully indoctrinated with these
            characters, and what they stand for (Enemies of Satan), we renounce
            them permanently in the dedication ritual. This proves to be

            YES!! The amount of blood does not matter, this is only a formality.
            What is in our hearts and what our intentions are, are much more
            important than the amount of blood in our signature.

            Satanic rituals, unlike the rituals in other religions, are real and

            Christians are deceived. They believe their "God" to be "loving" and
            "forgiving." In truth, this monster is a spiteful, hateful attacker
            of human beings. When one is with Satan, one is always under his
            protection. He looks out for us and we enter a new life where we no
            longer have the worries that others endure. Things are not perfect,
            but they are always much better. Satan does not punish people who
            reject him, he simply leaves and one is left all alone to endure the
            torments of the enemy.

            These people wrote to me because after several months, they were

            You can do the above ritual when you are older. Performing the
            dedication on the astral is every bit as valid as doing it
            physically. Satan is very understanding concerning teens who are
            forced into accepting Christianity while living at home and being
            underage.

            I am underage, living in a Christian home and my parents force me to
            go to church and participate in Christian sacraments. Can I still do
            the dedication? Will Satan be angry with me?

            Yes, you can still perform the ritual. Satan understands. As long as
            you are loyal to him in your heart, he will not be angry with you.
            Those of you under 18 are not free. There is no need to reveal your
            allegiance to Satan to anyone. What is in your heart is more
            important than anything else. Satan advises us in the Al-Jilwah not
            to reveal our religion to outsiders if it will cause us harm in any
            way, this is especially important for teens. Just renounce the
            Christian "God" in your mind if you are forced to participate in any
            of his garbage. Satan understands it can be downright dangerous, and
            in some cases even life-threatening for teens living in Christian
            homes to reveal their allegiance to him.{" "}
