          Spiritual Satanism differs from LaVeyan Satanism. We are aware of the
          existence of Satan/Lucifer as an actual being. We are not atheists! In
          spite of major discrepancies, the Church of Satan, founded 1966, by
          Anton Szandor LaVey, presently takes an atheistic stance as far as
          external deities are concerned, and views Satan as only an
          "archetype".

            2. "YHVH" otherwise known as "Jehovah" by the deluded, is a false
            entity. "YHVH" stands for the four elements and corners in the
            popular Jewish systems of magick that are available to the public.

            then being resurrected, and is another description of the alchemical
            operation of transforming the soul- death and then resurrection.

            remove all true spiritual knowledge and disarm the populace of their
            spiritual powers. Humanity has paid to the tune of trillions upon
            trillions of dollars, and with sickness, misery, and suffering due
            to the removal of this knowledge. Spiritual knowledge was
            systematically destroyed, twisted, and corrupted to SPIRITUALLY AND
            FINANCIALLY ENSLAVE US ALL. By force-feeding the populace that the
            Nazarene is a real entity, those at the top have maintained control
            and have reaped untold wealth and power.

            5. True Satanism preceded Christianity by thousands of years and is
            based upon total transformation of the soul. Christians are deluded
            into "accepting Jesus Christ" and "living saved" which is all false.
            Everything in the Christian religion is false and we prove this
            beyond all doubts. The Christian "saved" hoax is based upon stolen
            and corrupted knowledge of alchemy, where one truly works
            spiritually to transform one's soul into godhead.

          Many Traditional Satanists worship Satan/Lucifer. Some acknowledge him
          as a friend and do not worship. We respect individuality and personal
          choices. One's relationship with Satan/Lucifer is up to the
          individual, as Satanism values free thought and individuality.

        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          Satan is the bringer of knowledge. The goal of Spiritual Satanism is
          to apply this knowledge and transform our souls into godhead, as was
          originally intended by our Creator God Satan.
        </Text>
        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          Unlike most religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages one to question
          everything. Being one's personal best and exceeding limitations are
          the essence of Spiritual Satanism and this begins with using one's
          brains to their maximum potential.

          Spiritual Satanism does not in any way conflict with science. We
          strongly encourage and support all scientific knowledge and enquiry.
          We are well aware humanity is dangerously behind in scientific
          knowledge and understanding due to centuries of oppression by
          Christianity. We believe that all spiritual and paranormal phenomena
          can be scientifically explained in a rational manner; scientific
          knowledge has not yet progressed far enough to comprehend or explain
          much of the so-called "supernatural."
        </Text>
        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          There are no mediators in Spiritual Satanism. We strongly encourage
          our people to interact one on one with Satan. The ministry is here for
          guidance and support only. One's relationship with Satan is between
          that individual and Satan. We take the stance of "responsibility to
          the responsible." We place no limitations on knowledge or personal
          power and do everything we can to make all knowledge available to
          EVERYONE- not just a select few who are a self-appointed "elite" as
          with other religions. Satan encourages self-study, learning, direct
          experience.
        </Text>
        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          Most Spiritual Satanists make a commitment to Satan. The commitment is
          very important because Satan protects us as we work to advance our
          powers. Those who go it alone or without any spiritual protection
          often meet with disaster. Once one makes a commitment, Demons often
          guide us and work with us to help us advance. Unlike right hand path
          religions, Spiritual Satanism encourages action. Satan wants his
          people to live life to the fullest and to evolve.
        </Text>
        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          Satan is always there for us, but as we progress, he expects us to
          handle things, as we are able to, for ourselves, using our own powers.
          Christianity and its cohorts deliberately make cripples out of people.
          Christians forever rave about how their Nazarene has healed people.
          These people remain as slaves because they are never taught how to,
          nor are they required to heal themselves or others. The Nazarene
          archetype stands for slavery, servitude, and enduring endless abuse in
          order to program humanity to be the perfect slaves in a new world
          order. The Nazarene places total emphasis on the "afterlife" in order
          to create the mindset that the life we are now living does not matter.
          This frame of mind is essential for enduring all kinds of abuse for
          the benefit of a few.

          As for the so-called "miracles" connected with Christianity, any
          healings have been very few and far in-between. These are also based
          upon allegories related to transforming one's soul. Any human being
          with spiritual knowledge and power can accomplish all of the feats
          attributed to the Nazarene in the bible, and more. Most Christians are
          unaware that they are dealing with nefarious aliens [enemy Nordics
          also known as "angels" and another ET race known as the Greys], who
          put up a show every now and then to give credibility to the lie. With
          the New Age practitioners, many call upon angels for assistance and
          learn nothing. The same theme of human ignorance and powerlessness
          prevails. Satan/Lucifer is the True Creator God of, and the great
          liberator of humanity. He does not fear humans having spiritual power
          and knowledge because he is truthful and has nothing to hide.

          Satan gives us the knowledge to become independent and free. He
          directs us to be masters of our own lives and destinies. Satan and his
          Demons are always there to help us when there are things we cannot yet
          handle. Satan keeps his promises; he is consistent and loving with his
          own. Satan stands for freedom, strength, power, and justice. Satan
          shows us it is NOT OK for us to take abuse. He shows us that we are
          deserving of pleasure, happiness and a better life. He created us
          through genetic engineering, the same as scientists are now creating
          clones and working with genetics, but only on a much more advanced
          level.

          Many people disregard so-called" "occult" power, they do not take it
          seriously or are otherwise completely ignorant concerning it. The
          truth is, occult power has been in the hands of a few for centuries.
          Christianity has been their tool for removing this knowledge from the
          populace.

        <Text style={look.baseText}>
          Following the removal of knowledge, a fictitious past was invented to
          keep people from knowing the truth. People who do not understand or
          are unfamiliar with these skills are at the mercy of those who have
          them and who are adept at using them. Thousands of years ago in
          Ancient Egypt, this power was well known and most of the populace knew
          how to use it. With the arrival of Judeo/Christianity and Islam,
          knowledge was systematically destroyed wherever it was found.

          Cities, libraries, and any other sources of knowledge were destroyed
          in an attempt to annihilate all knowledge of the Original Gods [who
          are extraterrestrials] and the powers of the human soul. The Gods who
          interacted with, intermarried or befriended humanity were cursed and

          Humanity has been cut off from our True Creator God Satan and has

          destruction and disregard for the environment, the earth, and other
          living creatures are some of the effects of spiritual degeneration.
          Thousands of years ago, long before the coming of Judeo/Christianity,
          humans lived side by side with the Gods in the era known as "The

          Satan is the Sumerian God known as "EA" or "ENKI." He is a GOD, not an

          falsehoods and lies. Most people do not know Satan. They believe
          everything they are told about him without question. Fear is a
          powerful tool that has been used for centuries to keep humanity away

          Satan is the most brilliant and powerful of the Gods. He is symbolized
          by the Water Bearer of the sign of Aquarius, the 11th sign of the
          Zodiac. Aquarius is the sign of humanity, technology and genius. One
          of Satan's numbers is 11.

          Satan/Enki established the Ancient Egyptian Order of the Serpent, also
          known as "The Brotherhood of the Snake." Through the millennia, the
          teachings have been corrupted and no longer resemble the original
          doctrines. This Order was to bring humanity godly knowledge and power
          and to complete the Great Work of transforming our souls. This
          knowledge has been kept in the hands of a few and abused to the
          detriment of us all under the direction of the enemy gods. People are
          told if they are given this power, they will abuse it. This is another
          lie created and spread by those who deliberately use these powers for
          nefarious ends under the direction of the enemy extraterrestrials
          masquerading as "Jehovah" and company. To reveal these well-kept
          secrets to the average person would assure that those in control would

          The Gods are an extra-terrestrial humanoid race of beings. In the
          Christian bible, they are referred to as the "Nephilim." These beings
          are very evolved, highly advanced, and immensely knowledgeable and
          powerful. They genetically modified their DNA, so they do not age.

          In the Simon version of the Necronomicon [this book is based upon
          Mesopotamian/Sumerian mythology, even though classified as a work of
          fiction], the phrase: "When the Great Bear hangs low in the sky"
          refers to the constellation Ursa Major, part of the Big Dipper. When
          the planets align a certain way, it opens up a travel line for space
          travelers. People are always looking to the sky for when the Gods will
          return. Humanity's sole purpose was for use as slave laborers in the
          mines for the Nephilim. We were to be destroyed after the gold mining
          project was completed. Satan, along with many of the Nephilim fathered
          children with human mothers. These offspring were known as
          "Demi-Gods."

          Yes. He interacts with his Disciples and followers. Many of us have
          seen him, we have witnessed the so-called supernatural, and we have
          been given abilities way beyond that of the average person. When we
          ask, we get answers. Unlike other religions, where followers have to
          go searching for their gods, Satan/Lucifer comes to us. He lets us
          know of his presence.

          Demons, as opposed to all of the Christian lies, are friends of
          humanity. Demons, who are the Original Gods, give us much individual
          attention and protection, once a strong and trusted relationship is
          established. When we are close to, and under the protection of Satan,
          he gives us good Demons to work with. Their Sigils contain very
          important designs of alchemical symbols related to the opening of the
          soul.

          Satan is not "evil," nor is Satan responsible for the multitude of
          illnesses, diseases, or anything else that afflicts humanity. These

          "Hell" is not a burning lake of fire. Hell is not inside the Earth, as
          some foolish Christians claim in order to frighten people. The
          Christian concept of Hell is very ludicrous. Some of us, who are close
          to Satan, have seen Hell" all seem to have had the same experiences.
          Some places in Hell are dark and illuminated by a blue light, and in
          other places, there is daylight. One of Lucifer's colors is blue and
          Demons often appear with a blue light. Blue is a very spiritual color.
          I saw people sitting around a table in a bar in Hell, playing cards.
          The room was smoke filled, these people, already being dead, could
          smoke to their hearts content. These people were in spirit form. Some
          visit the earth to help humans who are on the Left Hand Path. This is
          where Satan keeps his own people until we can reincarnate and evolve
          into godhead.

          "Hell" and the "Lower world" are also allegories for the three lower
          chakras; "Hell" representing the base chakra. The reason for this is
          the fiery kundalini serpent lies coiled beneath the base chakra and
          when roused, it can be scorching hot.

          As opposed to hysterical Christian claims, Satanism is not in any way
          about blood sacrifice. All kinds of murder and living blood sacrifices
          can be seen all throughout the Judeo/Christian bible. The
          serpent/snake, which symbolizes Satan, represents the kundalini at the
          base of the spine, also the DNA. The serpent represents life. When
          this force is activated, we are healed and enlightened.
